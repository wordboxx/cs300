- ### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this course, we were trying to load and store information about courses and their prerequisites. Specifically, we were exploring the performance and scalability of various data structures like vectors, hash tables, and BSTs.

- ### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
We first implemented the data structures into our little program and then analyzed their time complexities, a runtime analysis, and used some reasoning to extrapolate out how each would scale and how that scalability will either maintain or degrade performance over time. Our results show the importance of understanding data structures, as each had their own speed, memory-handling, and volume-handling tradeoffs.

- ### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I did not really have trouble with any of the programming portions in these projects BUT I did have to do some more research about Big-O performance analyses, as I wanted to get into the nitty-gritty of best and worst-case behavior. I simply consulted both the course and external resources to better inform how I needed to think about it.

- ### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This was actually an elightening experience for me, as I am basically a script-kiddy. The biggest takeaway from this course will be keeping runtime performance and maintainability in mind, especially in reference to scale. Rather than, say, defaulting to one's preferred data structure out of comfort, each problem requires us to set aside our personal preferences and approach things such as choosing data structures with informed decisions that fit the scenario.

- ### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project incentivized modular code due to our independent, swapping data structure implementations. This required the entire project to be modular and adaptable, and in tandem with that, CLEAN AND CCONSISTENT to maintain readability.
